                    <blockquote>
                        I despise accounting, but I still chose that path due to parental pressure. I regret it now
                        because I wake up every
                        morning feeling the dread of going through finances, calculations, ledgers, etc. I did a
                        diagnostic test, which opened
                        my eyes to the different career paths that are suited to my lifestyle, personality,
                        interests,
                        etc. I will definitely be
                        seeking professional guidance hereon!
